# Classic Arcade game clone 
This game is like Frogger with bugs.

## How to Play
Download all files and open `index.html` in a Google Chrome browser - use the up, down, left, and right arrows to move the player and avoid the evil bugs! Get to the water and collect gems to earn points - enemy bug speed increases as your score gets higher. When you lose all your lives the evil bugs take over the world!
